# ATMega16_Timer0
This code snippet demonstrates an example of using the AVR microcontroller with the ATmega series, specifically utilizing Timer/Counter0 and interrupts. Let's go through the code step by step:

The code includes two header files: avr/io.h and avr/interrupt.h. These headers provide access to AVR-specific input/output and interrupt handling functions and definitions.

The declaration volatile uint8_t count; defines a global variable count of type uint8_t, which is an 8-bit unsigned integer. The volatile keyword indicates that the variable can be modified by external factors, such as interrupts, and its value may change unexpectedly.

The main() function is the entry point of the program. It configures the microcontroller's registers and enables interrupts.

DDRD |= (1<<6); sets the 6th bit of the DDRD register, configuring pin D6 (Digital Pin 6) of the AVR microcontroller as an output pin. This allows toggling its state later in the code.

TCNT0 = 0; sets the value of Timer/Counter0 (TCNT0) to 0. This register is responsible for counting timer ticks.

count = 0; initializes the count variable to 0.

TCCR0 &= ~(1<<CS01); clears the second bit (CS01) of the Timer/Counter0 Control Register (TCCR0), effectively disabling the clock source for Timer/Counter0. This step ensures that Timer/Counter0 is not running until explicitly configured.

TCCR0 |= (1<<CS02) | (1<<CS00); sets the first (CS00) and third (CS02) bits of TCCR0, selecting a clock source for Timer/Counter0. Here, it sets the prescaler to divide the system clock by 1024, which will be the clock source for Timer/Counter0.

TIMSK |= 1<<TOIE0; sets the first bit (TOIE0) of the Timer/Counter0 Interrupt Mask Register (TIMSK). This enables the Timer/Counter0 overflow interrupt, which will trigger an interrupt when TCNT0 overflows from 255 to 0.

sei(); enables global interrupts by setting the global interrupt enable bit in the Status Register (SREG). This step allows the microcontroller to respond to interrupts.

The code enters an infinite while loop (while (1) { ... }), where it waits for interrupts to occur. Since there is no code inside the loop, the program effectively stalls here.

The ISR(TIMER0_OVF_vect) is an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) that handles the Timer/Counter0 overflow interrupt. When the interrupt is triggered, the microcontroller jumps to this ISR to execute the corresponding code.

Inside the ISR, the condition if (count == 31) checks if count has reached the value of 31. If so, it toggles the state of pin D6 (PORTD ^= (1<<6)) using the bitwise XOR operator, and resets count to 0.

If count is not equal to 31, the else block increments count by 1.

Overall, this code initializes Timer/Counter0, enables its overflow interrupt, and toggles an output pin (D6) on every 32nd interrupt occurrence, creating a periodic square wave signal.
